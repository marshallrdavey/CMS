# CMS
Code base and repository for projects related to continuum mechanics.

This is sorted by program type. Python notebooks are welcome in the python
directory. A basic Makefile is included when needed. All images are included
for the LaTex files.

These are all in some state of development or another so they should compile,
but they might have bugs with respect to output. Any collaboration is welcome!
